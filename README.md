# Project title and description

Product Management Task board will be used to facilitate completion of organizational goals for the Product Management Team at Hack for LA. This will house communication needs, process discussions for product management and relevant action items for all product managers to contribute back to the common good. This is not a code repository, this is a repository of knowlege. A place for us to gather up effective practices with relevant examples from projects around Hack for LA and beyond.

# How to contribute
- Join our Product Mangement meeting every other Tuesday at 6pm PST

- Grab an issue from the [prioritized backlog](https://github.com/hackforla/product-managment/projects/2#column-10573805) on the [Templates and Guides board](https://github.com/hackforla/product-managment/projects/2) and find that asset on your project and document how it was created and how your team is using it.  If there are no issues on the prioritized backlog, then bring that up at the next PM meeting.

- Add a card to the [icebox](https://github.com/hackforla/product-managment/projects/2#column-10573804) for a template you are looking for, if that card does not already exist.
