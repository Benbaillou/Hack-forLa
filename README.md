# Project title and description

Product Management Task board will be used to facilitate completion of organizational goals for the Product Management Team at Hack for LA. This will house communication needs, process discussions for product management and relevant action items for the Executive Director of Hack for LA and the product management director. This is not a typical product board as there is no product that can be built as a part of this for now.This is for organization purposes only.

### Project context

There will be a link for the product management practice area, where the artifacts for that will be created will be in draft form temporarily and moved to their relevant product folder upon completion. 

### Technology used

- Git Hub-Product Management Repo
- Google Drive 
-Slack 



# How to contribute

Explain the different ways people can contribute. For example:







## Installation instructions

1. Step-by-step instructions help new contributors get a development environment up and running quickly.
2. You'll want to find the balance between being specific enough for novices to follow, without being so specific that you reinvent the wheel by providing overly-basic instructions that can be found elsewhere.
3. Feel free to adapt this section and its sub-sections to your own processes.
4. Alternatively, you can move everything from *Installation instructions* through *Testing* to a separate **Contributing.md** file to keep your **ReadMe.md** more succinct.
